Inheritance:
- prevented extending from prototypes since AST::TreeGenerator is not able to resolve the correct base type

Prototypes:
- handling of prototypes is now a bit more stable

System library:
- the system library has been updated to allow the use of generics
- all collections have been refactored to not use AbstractCollection as base any more
