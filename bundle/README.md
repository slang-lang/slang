# The Slang Programming Language

The Slang programming language is syntactically similar to Java and functionally similar to C++ (hence slang). In contrast to Java it offers more advanced features like operator overloading and RAII (both known from C++) and relies heavily on const-correctness. Checked exceptions are present but are strongly mitigated in contrast to Java's checked exceptions, which makes it easier to work with. With the statically typed parser/interpreter design time errors will be catched at.. design time, in contrast to dynamically typed languages where many errors will simply occur at run time. So syntax errors will be detected before running your program.
Slang offers native data types like bool, double, float, int and string as well as user defined object types and a system library with data types similar to the Java boxed types like Integer and String. Collections like List, Map, etc. can be used with object and value types and can also be used as raw types (i.e. List == List< Object >).
